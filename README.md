# Telegram stickers for matrix
This is a fork of ***Maunium sticker picker*** with lots and lots of telegram stickers.

Feel free to add or suggest your stickers in the [discussions](https://github.com/EsmailELBoBDev2/stickerpicker/discussions)

## What differs?
The different between this repo and original one is that my repo has more stickers (over 200 stickers from telegram) and some of stickers are animated thanks to [mstickereditor](https://crates.io/crates/mstickereditor) not static so enjoy!

## How to use it?
Please read [Enabling the widget](https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker/wiki/Enabling-the-widget) and replace the website's link with `https://esmailelbobdev2.github.io/stickerpicker/web/?theme=$theme`
